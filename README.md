# Firebird.Validator
Firebird Validator Project incl. Test.<br>
Firebird Validator is a project for parsing SQL and DDL under Firebird. In the first step, I put the commands into individual tokens. This is done by the scanner. In the second step, the parser is to validate the token. The parser is still in work.
